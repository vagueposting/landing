# Landing Page

The Landing Page a.k.a. the second page for the Odin Project.

I'm FREE!!!! I can finally head for the JavaScript killing fields!!

With that said, I'm glad to finally get a good grip on the idea. I still want to study the CSS grid system, but flexbox is *magical*. It's perfect for building responsive websites and UIs. Maybe I can build an actually good UI on Twine.
